# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

Your portfolio is ready for deployment! Follow these steps to make it live at smailosk.github.io:

## 📋 Steps to Enable GitHub Pages:

### 1. Rename Your Repository (IMPORTANT!)
- Visit: https://github.com/smailosk/portfolio/settings
- In the "Repository name" field, change it from `portfolio` to `smailosk.github.io`
- Click **"Rename"**

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
- Stay in Settings after renaming
- Scroll down to **"Pages"** in the left sidebar
- Under **"Build and deployment"**:
  - Source: Select **"GitHub Actions"**

### 3. Wait for Deployment
- Go to the **"Actions"** tab in your repository
- You should see the workflow running
- It takes 2-5 minutes to complete

### 4. Access Your Live Site
Your portfolio will be available at:
- 🌐 **https://smailosk.github.io/**

## 🔄 Automatic Updates
Every time you push changes to the `main` branch, the site will automatically update!

## ✅ Verify Deployment
1. Check Actions tab: All workflows should have green checkmarks
2. Visit your site URL
3. If it doesn't work immediately, wait 5-10 minutes (first deployment can be slow)

## 🎯 Custom Domain (Optional)
To use a custom domain like `ismailamor.com`:

1. In repository Settings > Pages
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS with your domain provider:
   - Add CNAME record pointing to `smailosk.github.io`
   - Or use A records for apex domain

## 📱 Share Your Portfolio
Once live, you can share your portfolio link:
- LinkedIn: Update your profile with the portfolio link
- Resume: Add the URL to your CV
- Email signature: Include the link

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
If the site doesn't appear:
1. Check Actions tab for any failed deployments
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check that the workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## 📊 Monitor Your SEO
After deployment, submit your site to:
- Google Search Console: https://search.google.com/search-console
- Bing Webmaster Tools: https://www.bing.com/webmasters

Your portfolio is SEO-optimized and ready to rank! 🎉
